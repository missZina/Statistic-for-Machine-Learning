# Statistic-for-Machine-Learning
Statistics is a basic pillar of machine learning. we cannot develop a deep idea and application of machine learning without it.

Statistics is important to machine learning practitioners.
 Statistics is a prerequisite in most courses and books on applied machine learning.
 Statistical methods are used at each step in an applied machine learning project.
 Statistical learning is the applied statistics equivalent of predictive modeling in machine
learning.
A machine learning practitioner cannot be effective without an understanding of basic
statistical concepts and statistics methods, and an effective practitioner cannot excel without
being aware of and leveraging the terminology and methods used in the sister field of statistical
learning.
